	[ CRUD Tags Used By gen-mysqlcrud ]

	Pre-Requisites
		1) If RowTS type of column exists, must name it as RowTS time.Time
		2) If supporting logical delete, must have columns IsDeleted bool, DeletedUTC sql.NullTime
		3) Must have variable _originalValue interface{} `db:"-"`

	ggTable:"?"
	ggDel:"Logical" (Indicate Logical Delete Support)

		3 = - | Set-TID 																		// (null int64)
		4 = - | Set-StoreID 																	// (null int64)
		5 = - | Set-ChainID 																	// (null int64)
		6 = - | Value: Prefix ATB Number If New 												// (null string, default 000000) if database has DBSetting, SettingEnum 9999 will contain DBNodeNumber if set during deploy, if so, ATB's BBBB is replaced with the DBNodeNumber during new counter creation
		7 = - | Value: Min Sequence Number If new 												// (null int64)
		8 = - | Value: Max Sequence Number If new 												// (null int64)
		9 = - | Value: Auto Reset Frequency If new 												// (null int32)

		6 = Def-Ins | Def-Upd | Def-InsUpd | Set-Ins | Set-Upd | Set-InsUpd | Set-Del | -		// column value injected by database default in certain action, or set by caller in certain action, - indicates N/A

		8 = Init (Parameter) | Fill (Parameter) | -												// If column participates in Init() or Fill() functions, and act as its parameter, - indicates N/A

		10= F=x;y;z | -																			// used only with GetBy, GetRanged, GetPatterned defined in 9, F indicates filter parameter for Get action;
																								   note 1: if Get uses field itself with no additional filters, no need for F declare;
																								   note 2: x;y;z indicates additional fields as part of the filter for lookup (each separated by semi-colon)
																								   note 3: *x = * is to indicate x as optional parameter, meaning parameter is defined as pointer
																								   note 4: x?? = ?? can optional be placed at end of x, on data types integer, float, or date; so that the matching logic for x can be other than Equals
																										   x== (Equals) this is the default, no need to indicate as it is assumed
																										   x<> (Not Equals) overrides x to compare on Not Equal; x is field in db or in collection list, right side of <> is the input value to compare against
																										   x<< (Less Than) overrides x to compare on Less Than; x is field in db or in collection list, right side of << is the input value to compare against
																										   x>> (Greater Than) overrides x to compare on Greater Than; x is field in db or in collection list, right side of >> is the input value to compare against
																										   x<= (Less or Equal) overrides x to compare in Less Than or Equal To; x is field in db or in collection list, right side of <= is the input value to compare against
																									       x>= (Greater or Equal) overrides x to compare in Greater Than or Equal To; x is field in db or in collection list, right side of >= is the input value to compare against
																										   x>< (Between) overrides x to compare using BETWEEN; x is the field in db or in collection list, x is queried between xFrom and xTo inclusive as input values
		11= Enum=foldername.EnumTypeName | -												    // indicates if this field is an enum, and defines the foldername.EnumTypeName convention, such as menuchoice.MenuChoice (This tag may be omitted if not enum field)
